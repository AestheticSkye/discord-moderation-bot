"""
Verification process is like this:

1. A user joins the server
2. Lookup if the user has been verified before:
     Yes: Do nothing
     No:  Continue
3. Add unverified role to user
     Hands off to role added listener

Verification button:
1. User verifies
2. Remove unverified role
    Hands off to role removed listener


Role added listener:
1. Enter in DB as unverified
2. Start a timer (in a subprocess)
3. At the end of the timer, check if the user is still marked as unverified
    Yes: Kick
    No:  Do nothing


Role removed listener:
1. Mark as verified in db

Notes:
- This could be done without roles but it allows for an easy interface
  for mods to mark users as verified and see who is/isnt verified
- Database use is necessary in order to remember if a user has previously joined
- Roles are considered the source of truth, db is only for the above
